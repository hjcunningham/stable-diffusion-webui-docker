# Stable Diffusion WebUI Docker

Run Stable Diffusion on your machine with a nice UI without any hassle!

## Introduction and Acknowledgement

Thank you for demonstrating interest in this repository by viewing this README.
The vast majority of this project is not my work, but rather a fork of the
[Stable Diffusion WebUI Docker](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker)
project managed by author [AbdBarho](https://github.com/AbdBarho), albeit with
some minor bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements for my own usage. After
having made a number of minor changes to a working clone of the codebase in the
past, and later losing those change when migrating from one workstation to
another, I decided the easiest way to persistently maintain those changes would
be to simply fork the repository.

If you find this fork useful, or if you have your own tweaks or improvements to
contribute, feel free to post a pull request, though it may be more productive to
submit such changes to either the [upstream repository](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker)
or to the [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
project maintained by [AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111).
